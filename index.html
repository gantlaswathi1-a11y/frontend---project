RRR is a 2022 Indian period action-drama film about two real-life Indian revolutionaries,
Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem, who become friends before discovering their
opposing allegiances during the British Raj, fighting against the tyrannical regime 
and each other before uniting in a display of brotherhood and rebellion. Directed
by S.S. Rajamouli, the film stars N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan in the lead roles
and is celebrated for its epic action, performances, music, and grand cinematic scale,
even as it takes liberties with historical events.
