    <h1 class="web">Web Development</h1>
    <p class="bg1 font1">
      Web Development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and
      web applications that run on the internet. It involves designing the
      layout, writing code, managing databases, and ensuring the website works
      properly on different devices and browsers. Web development is mainly
      divided into frontend development, which deals with the user interface
      using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and backend development, which handles
      server-side logic, databases, and user authentication using languages like
      Java, Python, PHP, or Node.js. Web developers also focus on website
      performance, security, and responsiveness to provide a smooth user
      experience. Today, web development plays a vital role in online services
      such as e-commerce, education, banking, and social media.

    <h1 class="ai" id="header2">Artifical Intelligence</h1>
    <p class="bg2 font2">
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses
      on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require
      human intelligence. These tasks include learning from data,
      problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, and image
      processing. AI systems use techniques such as machine learning, deep
      learning, and natural language processing to improve their performance
      over time. Artificial Intelligence is widely used in applications like
      virtual assistants, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, recommendation
      systems, and robotics. AI helps automate complex tasks, increase
      efficiency, and improve accuracy in various fields.

    <h1>Cyber Security</h1>
    <p class="bg3 font3">
      Cyber Security is the practice of protecting computers, networks, servers,
      and data from cyber attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. It involves
      using security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, encryption,
      and authentication to keep information safe. Cyber security helps prevent
      threats like hacking, malware, phishing, and data breaches. It is very
      important for protecting personal information, banking systems, government
      data, and online services. With the increase in internet usage, cyber
      security plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and secure digital
      communication.
