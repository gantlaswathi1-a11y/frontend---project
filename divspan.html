      <h1>Web Development</h1>
      <p>
        <span class="firstline"
          >Web Development is the process of creating and maintaining websites
          and web applications that run on the internet.</span
        >It involves designing the layout, writing code, managing databases, and
        ensuring the website works properly on different devices and browsers.
        Web development is mainly divided into frontend development, which deals
        with the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and backend
        development, which handles server-side logic, databases, and user
        authentication using languages like Java, Python, PHP, or Node.js. Web
        developers also focus on website performance, security, and
        responsiveness to provide a smooth user experience. Today, web
        development plays a vital role in online services such as e-commerce,
        education, banking, and social media.

          >Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that
          focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally
          require human intelligence.</span
        >
        Artificial Intelligence is widely used in applications like virtual
        assistants, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, recommendation
        systems, and robotics. AI helps automate complex tasks, increase
        efficiency, and improve accuracy in various fields.

        It involves using security measures such as firewalls, antivirus
        software, encryption, and authentication to keep information safe. Cyber
        security helps prevent threats like hacking, malware, phishing, and data
        breaches. It is very important for protecting personal information,
        banking systems, government data, and online services. With the increase
        in internet usage, cyber security plays a crucial role in ensuring safe
        and secure digital communication.
